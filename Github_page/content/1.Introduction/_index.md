Welcome to this hands-on tutorial workshop, designed to take your development workflow to the next level by connecting VSCode with Amazon EC2 instances. Whether youâ€™re accessing private instances, running VSCode in the cloud, or hosting a browser-based VSCode environment, this workshop will guide you through practical, real-world solutions to modern challenges in cloud-based development.  

### What Youâ€™ll Learn  
In this workshop, weâ€™ll explore a series of methods to connect and host VSCode in AWS environments. These techniques are applicable whether your instance has a public IP or is entirely private. By the end, you'll have gained a comprehensive toolkit to elevate your development capabilities using a combination of EC2, VSCode, and AWS services.  

### How This Workshop is Structured  
The content is framed as a set of challenges, with each challenge representing a new method of integrating VSCode with EC2. Youâ€™ll learn to:  
1. **Remote Development with VS Code:** Explore the powerful *Remote Development* extensions for connecting VS Code to EC2 instances.  
2. **Handling Private EC2 Instances:** Learn to work with private EC2 instances using AWS services like Instance Connect Endpoint and AWS Systems Manager.  
3. **Hosting VS Code as a Web App:** Set up VS Code or its open-source alternative (Code Server) as a web-based development environment.  
4. **Building and Deploying Custom AMIs:** Create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) with pre-configured VS Code setups for fast and consistent deployments.  
5. **Securing Remote Access:** Discover how to secure remote access using CloudFront, secure tunneling, and more.

This approach allows you to learn step-by-step, adapting solutions to fit your specific project needs and infrastructure.  

### Challenges Overview
